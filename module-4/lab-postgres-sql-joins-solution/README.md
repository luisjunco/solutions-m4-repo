# LAB | PostgreSQL Joins

<details>
  <summary>
   <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  </summary>

This exercise allows you to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class.

Upon completion of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Define PRIMARY and foreign keys in PostgreSQL tables.
- Use different types of JOIN operations to retrieve data from multiple tables.

## Introduction

Now that we've learned how to use primary and foreign keys to connect database tables and how to retrieve data from multiple tables using JOIN operations, it's time to apply this knowledge!

<br>

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

<br>

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

- Create a Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

<br>

## Deliverables

Since we will be querying our database from `psql`, you will need to copy/paste the query you entered in `psql`.

In the `queries.md` file, you will find the instructions about the query you need to perform in each iteration and a space to fill the answer.

<br>

### Example

Here is an example of how you should paste your SQL queries in the `queries.md` file for each iteration:

Find all technologies in the database:

```sql
#  This should be pasted in the queries.md file
SELECT * FROM technologies;
```

<br>

## Iteration 1 - Database Setup

First, let's set up our database with the tables and data we will be working with.

1. **Create Database**
   First, create a new database called `library`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library;
```

<br>

2. **Create Tables**

Next, we will create three tables that we will use during the lab: `authors`, `books`, and `publishers`.

Run the following SQL commands to create the database tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE authors (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    nationality VARCHAR(50),
    birth_year DATE
);

CREATE TABLE publishers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(100),
    founded_year INT
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author_id INT REFERENCES authors(id),
    publisher_id INT REFERENCES publishers(id),
    publish_date DATE
);
```

<br>

3. **Insert Data**

Now, let's insert some data into the tables you just created:

```sql
-- Insert authors
INSERT INTO authors (name, nationality, birth_year) VALUES
('J.K. Rowling', 'British', '1965-07-31'),
('George Orwell', 'British', '1903-06-25'),
('Mark Twain', 'American', '1835-11-30'),
('Agatha Christie', 'British', '1890-09-15'),
('Stephen King', 'American', '1947-09-21'),
('Charles Dickens', 'British', '1812-02-07'),
('Leo Tolstoy', 'Russian', '1828-09-09'),
('Virginia Woolf', 'British', '1882-01-25'),
('F. Scott Fitzgerald', 'American', '1896-09-24'),
('Harper Lee', 'American', '1926-04-28');

-- Insert publishers
INSERT INTO publishers (name, location, founded_year) VALUES
('Bloomsbury', 'London', 1986),
('Secker & Warburg', 'London', 1935),
('Chatto & Windus', 'London', 1855),
('Penguin Books', 'London', 1935),
('HarperCollins', 'New York', 1989),
('Simon & Schuster', 'New York', 1924),
('Random House', 'New York', 1927),
('Macmillan Publishers', 'London', 1843),
('Scholastic Inc.', 'New York', 1920),
('Hachette Book Group', 'New York', 2006);

-- Insert books
INSERT INTO books (title, author_id, publisher_id, publish_date) VALUES
('Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 1, 1, '1998-07-02'),
('Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', 1, 1, '2000-07-08'),
('1984', 2, 2, '1949-06-08'),
('Animal Farm', 2, 2, '1945-08-17'),
('Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', 3, 3, '1884-12-10'),
('The Adventures of Tom Sawyer', 3, 3, '1876-06-09'),
('Murder on the Orient Express', 4, 4, '1934-01-01'),
('Oliver Twist', 6, 6, '1837-02-01'),
('To Kill a Mockingbird', 10, 8, '1960-07-11'),
('The Mysterious Manuscript', NULL, NULL, '2019-11-05'),
('Echoes in the Void', NULL, NULL, '2020-07-13');
```

<br>

## Iteration 2 - Joins

In this iteration, you will need to use JOIN operations to query and combine data from the `authors`, `books`, and `publishers` tables, as explained in the tasks below.

After you run a query in your `psql` client and get the correct result, remember to write down the query in the `queries.md` file.

<br>

1. Using an **INNER JOIN**, list all books (left table) that have an assigned author (right table). The result should include only books with assigned authors.
   <br>

2. Using a **LEFT JOIN**, list all authors (left table) and their corresponding books on the (right table). The result should include all authors, including those who don't have any books assigned.

<br>

3. Using a **RIGHT JOIN**, list all books (right table) and their corresponding authors on the (left table). The result should include books without assigned authors.

<br>

4. Using a **FULL JOIN**, list all records from the `books` and `authors` tables. The result should include all details from both tables, even if there are no match.

<br>

## BONUS: Iteration 3 - Joins (continued)

1. Using an **INNER JOIN**, list all books (left table) and their corresponding publishers on the (right table). The result should include the book's title, publisher's name, and location.

<br>

2. Using a **LEFT JOIN**, list all publishers (left table) and any books they have published on the (right table). The result should include all publishers, including those who haven't published any books.

<br>

3. Using a **RIGHT JOIN**, list all books (right table) and their corresponding publishers on the (left table). The result should include all books, even those without a linked publisher.

<br>

4. Using a **FULL JOIN**, list all records from the `authors`, `books`, and `publishers` tables. The result should include all records from the three tables, even if there are no matches between them.

<br>

Happy Coding! ðŸ’™
