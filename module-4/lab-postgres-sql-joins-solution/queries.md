## Iteration 2 - Joins

1. Using an **INNER JOIN**, list all books (left table) that have an assigned author (right table). The result should include only books with assigned authors.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM books 
INNER JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.id;
```

<br>

2. Using a **LEFT JOIN**, list all authors (left table) and their corresponding books on the (right table). The result should include all authors, including those who don't have any books assigned.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM authors 
LEFT JOIN books ON authors.id = books.author_id;
```

<br>

3. Using a **RIGHT JOIN**, list all books (right table) and their corresponding authors on the (left table). The result should include books without assigned authors.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM authors 
RIGHT JOIN books ON authors.id = books.author_id;
```

<br>

4. Using a **FULL JOIN**, list all records from the `books` and `authors` tables. The result should include all details from both tables, even if there are no match.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM authors
FULL JOIN books ON authors.id = books.author_id;
```

<br>

## BONUS: Iteration 3 - Joins (continued)

1. Using an **INNER JOIN**, list all books (left table) and their corresponding publishers on the (right table). The result should include the book's title, publisher's name, and location.

```sql
SELECT books.title, publishers.name AS publisher_name, publishers.location
FROM books
INNER JOIN publishers ON books.publisher_id = publishers.id;
```

<br>

2. Using a **LEFT JOIN**, list all publishers (left table) and any books they have published on the (right table). The result should include all publishers, including those who haven't published any books.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM publishers
LEFT JOIN books ON publishers.id = books.publisher_id;
```

<br>

3. Using a **RIGHT JOIN**, list all books (right table) and their corresponding publishers on the (left table). The result should include all books, even those without a linked publisher.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM publishers
RIGHT JOIN books ON publishers.id = books.publisher_id;
```

<br>

4. Using a **FULL JOIN**, list all records from the `authors`, `books`, and `publishers` tables. The result should include all records from the three tables, even if there are no matches between them.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM authors
FULL JOIN books ON authors.id = books.author_id
FULL JOIN publishers ON books.publisher_id = publishers.id;
```
